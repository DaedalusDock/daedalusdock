Hey, I didn't wanna shove this in the PR body so I thought I'd stuff it in my folder:

Here's the pile of regexes I used to build the access helper PR:

I took airlock_all_access.dm as containing at least a sample of all accesses.
This seemed to work as there was no missing types.

Running the following regex:
---
Match:
^\/obj\/effect\/mapping_helpers\/([^\/]*)\/access\/all\/(.*$)\n\tgranted_all_access = list\(([^\)]*)\)
Replace:
MAKE_REAL($2, $3)
---
converted them all to the condensed slug-and-access format.

However, this didn't catch the abstract types, which were used to denote categories and set icon states.
Those were caught with the following regex:
---
Match:
^\/obj\/effect\/mapping_helpers\/([^\/]*)\/access\/all\/(.*$)\n\ticon_state = (.*$)
Replace:
MAKE_ABSTRACT($2, $3)
---

Finally, once that was done, a copy was made and all abstract make statements stripped by hand.
The following expression was then run to generate the update_paths control file:
---
Match:
^MAKE_REAL\((.*),.*$
Replace:
/obj/effect/mapping_helpers/airlock/access/all/$1 : /obj/effect/mapping_helpers/access/all/$1/airlock
/obj/effect/mapping_helpers/airlock/access/any/$1 : /obj/effect/mapping_helpers/access/any/$1/airlock
/obj/effect/mapping_helpers/windoor/access/all/$1 : /obj/effect/mapping_helpers/access/all/$1/windoor
/obj/effect/mapping_helpers/windoor/access/any/$1 : /obj/effect/mapping_helpers/access/any/$1/windoor
---

If you're porting this, I'm so sorry in advanced.
