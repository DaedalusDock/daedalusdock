/*
 * HOW IT WORKS
 *
 *The SSradio is a global object maintaining all radio transmissions, think about it as about "ether".
 *Note that walkie-talkie, intercoms and headsets handle transmission using nonstandard way.
 *procs:
 *
 * add_object(obj/device as obj, new_frequency as num, filter as text|null = null)
 *   Adds listening object.
 *   parameters:
 *     device - device receiving signals, must have proc receive_signal (see description below).
 *       one device may listen several frequencies, but not same frequency twice.
 *     new_frequency - see possibly frequencies below;
 *     filter - thing for optimization. Optional, but recommended.
 *              All filters should be consolidated in this file, see defines later.
 *              Device without listening filter will receive all signals (on specified frequency).
 *              Device with filter will receive any signals sent without filter.
 *              Device with filter will not receive any signals sent with different filter.
 *   returns:
 *    Reference to frequency object.
 *
 * remove_object (obj/device, old_frequency)
 *   Obliviously, after calling this proc, device will not receive any signals on old_frequency.
 *   Other frequencies will left unaffected.
 *
 *return_frequency(var/frequency as num)
 *   returns:
 *    Reference to frequency object. Use it if you need to send and do not need to listen.
 *
 *radio_frequency is a global object maintaining list of devices that listening specific frequency.
 *procs:
 *
 *   post_signal(obj/source as obj|null, datum/signal/signal, filter as text|null = null, range as num|null = null)
 *     Sends signal to all devices that wants such signal.
 *     parameters:
 *       source - object, emitted signal. Usually, devices will not receive their own signals.
 *       signal - see description below.
 *       filter - described above.
 *       range - radius of regular byond's square circle on that z-level. null means everywhere, on all z-levels.
 *
 * obj/proc/receive_signal(datum/signal/signal)
 *   Handler from received signals. By default does nothing. Define your own for your object.
 *   Avoid of sending signals directly from this proc, use spawn(0). Do not use sleep() here please.
 *     parameters:
 *       signal - see description below. Extract all needed data from the signal before doing sleep(), spawn() or return!
 *
 * datum/signal
 *   vars:
 *   source
 *     an object that emitted signal. Used for debug and bearing.
 *   data
 *     list with transmitting data. Usual use pattern:
 *       data["msg"] = "hello world"
 *   encryption
 *     Some number symbolizing "encryption key".
 *     Note that game actually do not use any cryptography here.
 *     If receiving object don't know right key, it must ignore encrypted signal in its receive_signal.
