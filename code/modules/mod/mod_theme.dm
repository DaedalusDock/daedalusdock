		destructive analysis of unknown technologies discovered on the Indecipheres mining sites, patterned off \
		their typical non-EVA exploration suits. The visor has been expanded to a system of seven arachnid-like cameras, \
		offering full view of the land and its soon-to-be-dead inhabitants. The armor plating has been trimmed down to \
		the bare essentials, geared far more for environmental hazards than combat against fauna; however, \
		this gives way to incredible protection against corrosives and thermal protection good enough for \
		both casual backstroking through molten magma and romantic walks through arctic terrain. \
		Instead, the suit is capable of using its' anomalous properties to attract and \
		carefully distribute layers of ash or ice across the surface; these layers are ablative, but incredibly strong. \
		Lastly, the suit is capable of compressing and shrinking the mass of the wearer, as well as \
		rearranging its own constitution, to allow them to fit upright in a sphere form that can \
		roll around at half their original size; leaving high-powered mining ordinance in its wake. \
		However, all of this has proven to be straining on all power cells, \
