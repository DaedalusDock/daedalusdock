changes:
  - rscadd: Changed how cleaning blood works. Standard cleaners will remove the blood
      visually, but traces will remain.
  - rscadd: Added Luminol, a reagent which causes traces of blood to glow a bright
      blue.
  - rscadd: Added Sterilizine, an ultra-powerful cleaning reagent that removes traces
      of blood, and can be used to sterilize wounds.
  - rscadd: Added Sterilize Wound surgery, which can be performed with Sterilizine
      or high concentration ethanol.
  - rscadd: Added a UV Light item, which reveals traces of blood nearby. Can be purchased
      from cargo for a large amount of marks. (Because it invalidates Luminol)
  - rscadd: P.I's Investigate Mode reveals traces of blood nearby for the P.I only.
      Does not reveal blood on items like Luminol or the UV Light.
  - rscadd: Added a new interaction for Investigate Mode involving a chair.
