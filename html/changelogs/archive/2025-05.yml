  Kapu1178:
  - bugfix: Fixed (hopefully) all instances of run-away floating point precision issues
      in atmospherics. All molar and pressure values should now always be rounded
      to the ten-thousandths place.
  - bugfix: Fixed a mathematical error in Vent Pump code that made them siphon slower
      than intended.
  LemonInTheDark, Ben10omintrix, Ghommie, Smartkar, Kapu1178:
  - balance: Monkeys will now lose hatred over time if they aren't able to attack
      their target. (This includes attempting to attack while the target is incapacitated!)
  - balance: Monkeys attack 50% slower.
  - balance: Monkeys have a higher initial hatred, but it decays sooner.
